## 1. Describe the Problem
Test-Driving a multi-class program to reinforce Testing skills.

## 2. Design the Class Interface


```python
# EXAMPLE
class Diary:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def add(self, entry):
        # Parameters:
        #   entry: an instance of DiaryEntry
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the entry to the entries list
        pass

    def all(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A list of instances of DiaryEntry
        pass

    def count_words(self):
        # Returns:
        #   An integer representing the number of words in all diary entries
        # HINT:
        #   This method should make use of the `count_words` method on DiaryEntry.
        pass

    def reading_time(self, wpm):
        # Parameters:
        #   wpm: an integer representing the number of words the user can read
        #        per minute
        # Returns:
        #   An integer representing an estimate of the reading time in minutes
        #   if the user were to read all entries in the diary.
        pass

    def find_best_entry_for_reading_time(self, wpm, minutes):
        # Parameters:
        #   wpm:     an integer representing the number of words the user can
        #            read per minute
        #   minutes: an integer representing the number of minutes the user has
        #            to read
        # Returns:
        #   An instance of DiaryEntry representing the entry that is closest to,
        #   but not over, the length that the user could read in the minutes
        #   they have available given their reading speed.
        pass
```

```python
#EXAMPLE
class DiaryEntry:
    # Public Properties:
    #   title: a string
    #   contents: a string

    def __init__(self, title, contents): # title, contents are strings
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the title and contents properties
        pass

    def count_words(self):
        # Returns:
        #   An integer representing the number of words in the contents
        pass

    def reading_time(self, wpm):
        # Parameters:
        #   wpm: an integer representing the number of words the user can read
        #        per minute
        # Returns:
        #   An integer representing an estimate of the reading time in minutes
        #   for the contents at the given wpm.
        pass

    def reading_chunk(self, wpm, minutes):
        # Parameters:
        #   wpm: an integer representing the number of words the user can read
        #        per minute
        #   minutes: an integer representing the number of minutes the user has
        #            to read
        # Returns:
        #   A string representing a chunk of the contents that the user could
        #   read in the given number of minutes.
        # If called again, `reading_chunk` should return the next chunk,
        # skipping what has already been read, until the contents is fully read.
        # The next call after that it should restart from the beginning.
        pass
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests


``` python
# EXAMPLE
def test_init():
    #Tests if the init method initialises correctly ensuring the class works
    pass

def test_add():
    #Tests if entry is correctly added to the entry list
    pass

def test_all():
    #Tests if the method returns all the current instances of DiaryEntry
    pass

def test_count_words():
    #Tests to ensure the correct value is calculated
    pass

def test_reading_time():
    #Tests if method returns correct value
    pass

def test_best_entry():
    #Tests if method returns correct value
    pass
```

```python
#EXAMPLE

def test_init():
    #Tests if the init method initialises correctly ensuring the class works
    pass

def test_count_words():
    #Tests to ensure the correct value is calculated
    pass

def test_reading_time():
    #Tests for correct return
    pass

def test_reading_chunk():
    #Tests for correct return

```
